Acknowledgments:
----------------

Frostgiant, Parasyte, and DogP (and the rest of people that have contributed
to the VB sceen in the last five years) - Their work on Red_Dragon has been a
real inspiration. Its amazing how far they have gone with so little to start
with.

Bob VanderClay - most of the original code is based off
of his VB disassembler.

Ben Haynor - Provided me with a much better understanding of
the VB internals.

Joseph LoCicero, Dave Shadoff - I stole the jump table ideas from their tg16
disassembler, thanks guys.

Neill Corlett - took many ideas (and some code)
from his Starscream CPU core

Kevin Banks - for donating a very nice pair of Frenzle 3D
viewers, and being an all around great guy.

Megan Tucker - For putting up with my tinkering all night, and resisting the
urge to toss all my video games out the window.

v810 is a trademark of NEC co.
Virtual Boy is a trade mark of Nintendo
Reality Boy is in no way affiliated with either of these parties
